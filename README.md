# CSCI-135-Project-1

In this programming assignment, implement an employee salary calculator. Write a concise main and well defined functions. 
The key to solving this programming assignment is to first understand problem, then design the solution and finally implement. 

1.1 Commenting
Note that you will lose points if you do not comment your code. Commenting is 10% of the
overall assignment grade. Apart from explaining what block of code is doing, you should also
write a brief description of your program at the top
of your .cpp files using multi-line comments (/* ... */). Meaningful comments will also
assist the instructor in understanding your code easily.
See programming rules document under course material for a detailed explanation.

1.2 Design
One of the more important things in programming is planning, even for the simplest
program. If the planning is thorough, the coding will be easy, and the only errors likely to
be encountered are syntax errors, usually caused by either typing errors, a boundary
condition problem (frequently, an off by one error), or (we hope not) lack of knowledge of
the language details.

1.3 Background
A company wants you to write payroll management to be able to enter each employers salary
and other information. Based on what the user enters, your program needs to calculate their Net
pay, after conditional deductions from their salary.

1.4 Programming Details
This program must be written using functions - breaking the entire program into smaller tasks.
Each task will be written as a functions, take in appropriate arguments and based on usage return
values back from the function.
Please follow the sample output as specified. Your program must follow the sample output as
specified.
